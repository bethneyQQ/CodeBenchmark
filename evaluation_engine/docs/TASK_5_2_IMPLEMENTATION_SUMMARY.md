    cost: float = 0.0
    response_time: float = 0.0
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None
```

### 2. Factory Function
```python
def create_model_adapter(provider: str, model_id: str, api_key: str = None, **kwargs) -> ModelAdapter:
    """Create model adapter for any supported provider"""
```

def validate_model_configuration(provider: str, model_id: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
    """Validate configuration before creating adapter"""
```

### 4. Plugin Registry Integration
All adapters are registered with the plugin system using decorators:
```python
@register_model_adapter("openai", {"provider": "OpenAI", "supports_chat": True})
class OpenAIModelAdapter(ModelAdapter):
    # Implementation
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating Adapters
```python

openai_adapter = create_model_adapter('openai', 'gpt-4', api_key='your-key')
claude_adapter = create_model_adapter('anthropic', 'claude-3-sonnet-20240229', api_key='your-key')
local_adapter = create_model_adapter('huggingface', 'microsoft/DialoGPT-small')

# Direct instantiation
qwen_adapter = DashScopeModelAdapter('qwen-max', api_key='your-key')
```

### Using with lm-eval
```python
# All adapters are compatible with lm-eval's evaluation framework
from lm_eval import simple_evaluate

results = simple_evaluate(
    model=openai_adapter,
    tasks=['hellaswag', 'arc_easy'],
    num_fewshot=5
)
```
