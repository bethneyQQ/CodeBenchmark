import requests

# Login
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login', 
                        params={'username': 'user', 'password': 'pass'})
token = response.json()['access_token']

# Create evaluation
headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
evaluation_data = {
    'model_id': 'gpt-4',
    'task_ids': ['single_turn_scenarios_code_completion'],
    'configuration': {'temperature': 0.7}
}
response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/api/v1/evaluations',
