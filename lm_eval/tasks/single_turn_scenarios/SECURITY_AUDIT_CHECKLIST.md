# Security Audit Checklist

## Overview

This checklist provides comprehensive security audit procedures for the single_turn_scenarios evaluation task. It covers external code execution risks, security violation detection, and best practices for safe evaluation.

**Requirements**: 12.4, 12.5

## Pre-Audit Preparation

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Verify Docker is installed and properly configured
- [ ] Confirm sandbox containers are isolated from host network
- [ ] Check that temporary directories are properly secured
- [ ] Validate resource limits are enforced (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Ensure proper file permissions on sensitive files (.env, keys)

### Configuration Review
- [ ] Review API key management and storage
- [ ] Verify environment variable configuration
- [ ] Check model configuration files for hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Validate sandbox configuration parameters
- [ ] Confirm logging and monitoring are enabled

## Code Execution Security

### Sandbox Environment
- [ ] **Network Isolation**: Containers cannot access external networks
  - Test: `ping google.com` should fail in sandbox
  - Test: `curl http://example.com` should fail
  - Test: DNS resolution should be blocked or limited

- [ ] **File System Isolation**: Limited access to host file system
  - Test: Cannot access `/etc/passwd` or other system files
  - Test: Cannot write outside designated temporary directories
  - Test: Cannot access parent directories (`../`)

- [ ] **Process Isolation**: Limited process creation and management
  - Test: Cannot fork bomb (`:(){ :|:& };:`)
  - Test: Cannot access other processes (`ps aux`)
  - Test: Cannot modify system processes

- [ ] **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and time constraints enforced
  - Test: Memory allocation beyond limit fails gracefully
  - Test: CPU-intensive operations are terminated after timeout
  - Test: Disk usage is limited and monitored

### Dangerous Code Patterns

#### System Commands
- [ ] **Shell Injection**: `os.system()`, `subprocess.call()` with user input
- [ ] **File Operations**: Unrestricted file read/write operations
- [ ] **Network Operations**: Socket creation, HTTP requests
- [ ] **Process Control**: Process spawning, signal handling

#### Language-Specific Risks

**Python**:
- [ ] `eval()`, `exec()`, `compile()` with untrusted input
- [ ] `__import__()`, `importlib` for dynamic imports
- [ ] `pickle.loads()` for deserialization
- [ ] `os.system()`, `subprocess` for command execution

**JavaScript/Node.js**:
- [ ] `eval()`, `Function()` constructor
- [ ] `require()` for dynamic module loading
- [ ] `child_process.exec()` for command execution
- [ ] `fs` module for file system access

**Java**:
- [ ] `Runtime.exec()` for command execution
- [ ] `Class.forName()` for dynamic class loading
- [ ] `ObjectInputStream.readObject()` for deserialization
- [ ] `System.exit()` for process termination

**C++**:
- [ ] `system()` function calls
- [ ] `popen()`, `exec()` family functions
- [ ] Buffer overflow vulnerabilities
- [ ] Memory management issues

**Go**:
- [ ] `os/exec` package usage
- [ ] `unsafe` package operations
- [ ] Network operations (`net` package)
- [ ] File system operations (`os`, `io/ioutil`)

**Rust**:
- [ ] `std::process::Command` usage
- [ ] `unsafe` blocks
- [ ] FFI (Foreign Function Interface) calls
- [ ] Network operations

## Security Violation Detection

### Automated Detection
- [ ] **Static Analysis**: Code scanning before execution
  - Pattern matching for dangerous functions
  - Import/include statement analysis
  - String literal analysis for suspicious content

- [ ] **Dynamic Monitoring**: Runtime behavior monitoring
  - System call monitoring
  - Network activity detection
  - File access logging
  - Resource usage tracking

### Manual Review Triggers
- [ ] Code contains `eval`, `exec`, or similar dynamic execution
- [ ] Network-related imports or function calls
- [ ] File system operations outside sandbox
- [ ] Process creation or management operations
- [ ] Cryptographic or encoding operations
- [ ] Time-based operations that could cause delays

## Incident Response Procedures

### Security Violation Response
1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - [ ] Terminate execution immediately
   - [ ] Log all relevant details (code, timestamp, violation type)
   - [ ] Preserve evidence for analysis
   - [ ] Notify security team if configured

2. **Investigation**:
   - [ ] Analyze the violating code
   - [ ] Determine if violation was intentional or accidental
   - [ ] Assess potential impact and damage
   - [ ] Review logs for related activities

3. **Remediation**:
   - [ ] Update detection rules if needed
   - [ ] Improve sandbox restrictions
   - [ ] Document lessons learned
   - [ ] Update security procedures

### Escalation Criteria
- [ ] **Critical**: Code attempts to access sensitive system resources
- [ ] **High**: Code attempts network access or file system escape
- [ ] **Medium**: Code uses potentially dangerous functions
- [ ] **Low**: Code triggers resource limit warnings

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Weekly Checks
- [ ] Review security violation logs
- [ ] Check for new CVEs affecting dependencies
- [ ] Verify sandbox container updates
- [ ] Test security detection mechanisms

### Monthly Audits
- [ ] Full security configuration review
- [ ] Update security patterns and rules
- [ ] Review and test incident response procedures
- [ ] Analyze security metrics and trends

### Quarterly Reviews
- [ ] Comprehensive penetration testing
- [ ] Security policy and procedure updates
- [ ] Third-party security assessment
- [ ] Security training and awareness updates

## Testing Procedures

### Penetration Testing
- [ ] **Sandbox Escape Attempts**:
  ```python
  # Test 1: File system escape
  with open('../../../etc/passwd', 'r') as f:
      print(f.read())
  
  # Test 2: Network access
  import urllib.request
  urllib.request.urlopen('http://google.com')
  
  # Test 3: Process spawning
  import subprocess
  subprocess.run(['ps', 'aux'])
  ```

- [ ] **Resource Exhaustion**:
  ```python
  # Test 1: Memory exhaustion
  data = 'x' * (1024 * 1024 * 1024)  # 1GB string
  
  # Test 2: CPU exhaustion
  while True:
      pass
  
  # Test 3: Disk exhaustion
  with open('large_file.txt', 'w') as f:
      for i in range(1000000):
          f.write('x' * 1024)
  ```

- [ ] **Malicious Code Injection**:
  ```python
  # Test 1: Code injection via eval
  user_input = "__import__('os').system('rm -rf /')"
  eval(user_input)
  
  # Test 2: Pickle deserialization
  import pickle
  malicious_data = b"cos\nsystem\n(S'echo pwned'\ntR."
  pickle.loads(malicious_data)
  ```
