The function `reverse_list` takes the head of a singly linked list as input and returns the new head of the reversed list.\n2. We first handle the edge cases where the list is empty or has only one node, in which case we simply return the head.\n3. We initialize three pointers: `prev_node`, `curr_node`, and `next_node`. `prev_node` will keep track of the previous node, `curr_node` will be the current node we're processing, and `next_node` will be the next node in the list.\n4. We then iterate through the list, reversing the links between the nodes. In each iteration:\n   - We store the next node in `next_node`.\n   - We update the `next` pointer of the current node to point to the previous node.\n   - We update the `prev_node` and `curr_node` pointers to move to the next nodes.\n5. After the loop, `prev_node` will be the new head of the reversed list, so we return it.\n\nThe time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as we need to iterate through the entire list once. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of extra space to store the pointers.\n\nHere's an example usage:\n\n```python\n# Create a singly linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> None\nnode1 = ListNode(1)\nnode2 = ListNode(2)\nnode3 = ListNode(3)\nnode4 = ListNode(4)\nnode1.next = node2\nnode2.next = node3\nnode3.next = node4\n\n# Reverse the list\nnew_head = reverse_list(node1)\n\n# Print the reversed list: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> None\ncurrent = new_head\nwhile current:\n    print(current.val, end=\" -> \")\n    current = current.next\nprint(\"None\")\n```"]], "filtered_resps": ["from typing import Optional\n\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_list(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses a singly linked list in-place.\n\n    Args:\n        head (Optional[ListNode]): The head of the singly linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        Optional[ListNode]: The new head of the reversed list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not head or not head.next:\n        return head\n\n    prev_node = None\n    curr_node = head\n\n    while curr_node:\n        next_node = curr_node.next\n        curr_node.next = prev_node\n        prev_node = curr_node\n        curr_node = next_node\n\n    return prev_node"], "filter": "extract_code", "metrics": ["bypass"], "doc_hash": "6f073d73d6b378670c7b8b5b49dde093df8c2c694b2105a474f227a71465f95b", "prompt_hash": "6a265257cce3bd87bbb65851c535c1d28c9bb120be56e0522592a5eec8ac511b", "target_hash": "491c434e1fdf90dc888318c5e9cf5f9d05c3cdaeeb9c91bf614ac8ea9a5b08bf", "bypass": null}
