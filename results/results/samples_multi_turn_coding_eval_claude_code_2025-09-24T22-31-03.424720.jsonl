The target audience is complete beginners learning HTML, and the page must work on IE11+ and mobile devices, with a page load time under 2 seconds. It should also support screen readers for accessibility, include a favicon and proper meta tags for SEO, and meet other quality and performance requirements.\n\nUser Stories and Acceptance Criteria:\n1. As a user, I want to see a greeting message on the page so that I can understand the purpose of the website.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: The page displays a clear and welcoming greeting message.\n2. As a user, I want to see the current date on the page so that I can easily reference the date.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: The current date is displayed on the page in a readable format.\n3. As a user with a screen reader, I want to be able to access the content of the page so that I can fully engage with the website.\n   - Acceptance Criteria: The page is screen reader accessible and provides proper semantic markup.\n\nFunctional and Non-Functional Requirements:\n- The page must display a greeting message and the current date.\n- The page must work on IE11+ and mobile devices.\n- The page load time must be less than 2 seconds.\n- The page must support screen readers for accessibility.\n- The page must include a favicon and proper meta tags for SEO.\n- The design must use responsive CSS Grid/Flexbox layout.\n- The color contrast ratio must be at least 4.5:1.\n- The page must use system fonts only, with no external dependencies.\n- The page must follow a progressive enhancement approach and support offline viewing.\n- The HTML and CSS must be valid and comply with W3C standards.\n- The Lighthouse score must be greater than 90.\n- The page must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.\n- The total page size must be less than 50KB.\n\nSuccess Metrics:\n- The page must pass W3C validation.\n- The Lighthouse score must be greater than 90.\n- The page must be WCAG 2.1 AA compliant.\n- The page must work correctly on the target browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).\n- The page load time must be less than 2 seconds.\n\nSaved to: ./output/easy_001/prd.md\n\nPhase 1 complete."]], "filtered_resps": [["Understood.
