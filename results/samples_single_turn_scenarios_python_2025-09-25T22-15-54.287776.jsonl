The function takes the `head` of the singly linked list as input, which is an `Optional[ListNode]` type.\n2. The function returns the new `head` of the reversed list, which is also an `Optional[ListNode]` type.\n3. The function first checks if the `head` is `None` or if the list has only one node. In these cases, the function simply returns the `head` as the list is already reversed.\n4. The function then initializes three pointers: `prev_node`, `curr_node`, and `next_node`. `prev_node` is initially set to `None`, `curr_node` is set to the `head`, and `next_node` is used to store the next node in the list.\n5. The function then enters a loop that continues until `curr_node` becomes `None`. In each iteration of the loop, the function performs the following steps:\n   - Stores the next node in the list in the `next_node` variable.\n   - Updates the `next` pointer of the current node to point to the previous node.\n   - Updates the `prev_node` to the current node.\n   - Updates the `curr_node` to the next node in the list.\n6. After the loop completes, the function returns the `prev_node`, which is now the new head of the reversed list.\n\nThe time complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, as the function needs to traverse the entire list once. The space complexity is O(1), as the function only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the pointers."]], "filtered_resps": ["from typing import Optional\n\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef reverse_list(head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Reverses a singly linked list in-place.\n\n    Args:\n        head (Optional[ListNode]): The head of the singly linked list.\n\n    Returns:\n        Optional[ListNode]: The new head of the reversed list.\n    \"\"\"\n    if not head or not head.next:\n        return head\n\n    prev_node = None\n    curr_node = head\n\n    while curr_node:\n        next_node = curr_node.next\n        curr_node.next = prev_node\n        prev_node = curr_node\n        curr_node = next_node\n\n    return prev_node"], "filter": "extract_code", "metrics": ["bypass"], "doc_hash": "6f073d73d6b378670c7b8b5b49dde093df8c2c694b2105a474f227a71465f95b", "prompt_hash": "6a265257cce3bd87bbb65851c535c1d28c9bb120be56e0522592a5eec8ac511b", "target_hash": "491c434e1fdf90dc888318c5e9cf5f9d05c3cdaeeb9c91bf614ac8ea9a5b08bf", "bypass": null}
