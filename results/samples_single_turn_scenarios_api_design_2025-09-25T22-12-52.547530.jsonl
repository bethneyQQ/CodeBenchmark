Here's a high-level overview of the solution:\n\n1. **Project Structure**:\n   - Create a Flask-based web application with the following structure:\n     - `app/`\n       - `api/`\n         - `v1/`\n           - `users/`\n           - `auth/`\n       - `models/`\n       - `utils/`\n       - `config.py`\n       - `app.py`\n\n2. **User Management**:\n   - `User` model:\n     - `id`, `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`\n   - Endpoints:\n     - `POST /api/v1/users`: Create a new user\n     - `GET /api/v1/users`: List all users (admin-only)\n     - `GET /api/v1/users/<user_id>`: Retrieve a user's details (admin-only)\n     - `PUT /api/v1/users/<user_id>`: Update a user's details (admin-only)\n     - `DELETE /api/v1/users/<user_id>`: Delete a user (admin-only)\n\n3. **Authentication**:\n   - `Auth` model:\n     - `id`, `user_id`, `token`, `expires_at`\n   - Endpoints:\n     - `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Authenticate a user and return an access token\n     - `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`: Revoke the current user's access token\n     - `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh`: Refresh the current user's access token\n\n4. **Role-based Access Control**:\n   - Implement a role-based access control system with two roles: `admin` and `user`.\n   - Restrict access to certain endpoints based on the user's role.\n   - Use the `@requires_role` decorator to enforce role-based access control.\n\n5. **Security**:\n   - Use Flask-JWT-Extended for token-based authentication.\n   - Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).\n   - Use secure password hashing (e.g., Bcrypt) and follow best practices for password storage.\n\n6. **Testing**:\n   - Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., models, utils).\n   - Write integration tests for the API endpoints, covering both successful and error cases.\n   - Use a testing framework like pytest and mock libraries as needed.\n\n7. **Documentation**:\n   - Document the public API using Swagger/OpenAPI.\n   - Add docstrings to all public functions and classes.\n   - Provide a README file with installation instructions, usage examples, and any other relevant information.\n\n8. **Performance**:\n   - Use list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate to improve efficiency.\n   - Leverage built-in functions and standard library modules to take advantage of optimized implementations.\n   - Consider caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.\n\n9. **Deployment**:\n   - Package the application using a tool like Docker or Pipenv.\n   - Implement a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the build, test, and deployment process.\n\nThis is a high-level overview of the solution.
